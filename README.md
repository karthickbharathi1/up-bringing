# up-bringing

This is a task and I have completed the task for the full stack developer role. 
The task was to develop a Dashboard consists of results regarding the questions asked to parents o track and present metrics for measuring a child's progress throughout their educational journey.
I asked questions on the Motor metrics and Cognitive metrics.
In motor metrics , ichose three fields - 'grossScore', 'socialScore', 'fineScore'
In cognitive  metrics , ichose three fields - 'scientificScore', 'entreScore', 'musicalScore'
This was a wonderful experience and a bit challenging too.
At first, I had no idea where to start, but slowly I got to understand what I had to create and finally, I have done it.
I have used React Js for Frontend, Node Js for Backend, and MongoDB for the Database.
Firstly, I finished the Login and Register page for the DASHBOARD. i designed my page and used Tailwind CSS for making things easier(I love Tailwind).

Then I created the backend for the login and register routed. 
After Successfully implementing the login and register page ,  i had started creating the dashboard page.
In the dashboard page, I have three states to refer to the menu state, the Quiz state, and the end state.

To explain that, I will simply state each one.
The menu state is the ready state that when we click start, we will go the Quiz state.
The Quiz state is the place where the questions will be asked to the parents aboutt their child.
And then finally the EndState where the results will be shown in the form of charts and graphs.

Here I used Context API . to have the states accessible to all the pages and it is a very important thing to pass values to all the pages very easily.

I have deployed the app using render and netlify.
I tried to deploy using vercel but I faced some issues.

Overall, it was a wonderful learning experince for me, and thanks for giving me an oppurutnity to showcase my skills.
